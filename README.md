# r7-moose-dalle2-project

I generated these images using the DALLE-2 https://openai.com/dall-e-2/ AI model.
This model takes natural language prompts and generates a set of 4 images. The images can vary wildly based on the languages content, tone, emotion etc.


The images generated were used for a Rapid7 internal competition. 

Some of the prompts I provided this model are:
 	‘A proud moose standing in a forest, ’
  ‘A large orange moose, in the style of starry night’, 
  ‘A stained glass mural of a majestic moose.’
